# What the heck is this?

**TradeFlare** is my custom client interface for [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/), an API-based game in which you manage a fleet of ships and traverse the galaxy. You can interact with it in any language that can make HTTP requests.

TradeFlare is a serverless tool, intended to be used with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The backend is built using the [Hono](https://hono.dev) framework, and the frontend is made using my custom UI tool, [pagery](https://github.com/tycrek/pagery).
